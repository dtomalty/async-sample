            <div>
                We can help workers get on top of their workloads and mitigate work-life balance conflicts by moving away from hyper-responsiveness and real-time communication towards greater asynchronous communication — the type that truly gives people the freedom to decide when and where to work.

                Asynchronous allows people to structure their days to be more productive...people can design their own work time, their own work environment, and can tailor it to what they know about themselves to get their own personal best work done.

                        Unnecessary meetings waste an estimated $37 billion in salary hours a year in the U.S. alone, tanking both worker productivity and job satisfaction.

                        Async work replaces unproductive, morale-killing meetings with writing or prerecorded video, so everyone can catch up on their own schedules.

                        Fast responses may feel productive, but they require everyone to work in a constant state of reactive context-switching making it impossible to focus.

                        Async work allows people to create long, uninterrupted blocks of time for deep work and chunk their communication time together instead of spreading it throughout the day.

                        Measuring performance by hours worked keeps people chained to the traditional workday and incentivizes presenteeism rather than meaningful productivity.

                        Async work lets people choose the hours that work best for them and puts the focus back where it should be: on the actual work getting done.
